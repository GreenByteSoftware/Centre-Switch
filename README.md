# Centre Switch

This is a game I worked on during Hacker Games: Kaunas hackathon and later decided to open source. This includes all the assets used in the game and all the scenes. The only changed part is road.

Everything is licensed under GPL3, except everything in folders "3rd party", "Models", "Plugins" and "Standard Assets" so you are free to use the code for learning. Speaking of code, there are quite a few hacks used so try to avoid them in your actual game.
